1)Difference between List and Dict
#list is group of elements seperated by comma, and enclosed with sqare bracket []
#list are mutable
#list support slicing

l1=[2,3.6,'abhi',500]
print(l1)

#dictionaries is group of elements with key and value pair and enclosed with curly bracket {}

dict={'name':'abhi','num':200}
print(dict)


2)if a=[1 2 3 4 5], what is the value of a[-1] ?
a=[1,2,3,4,5]
print(a[-1])


3)Create a list of integer from 0 to 9.

method 1
------------
#list of integer from 0 to 99
num=[x for x in range(0,100)]
print(num)

method 2
------------
number=int(input("n :"))
val=0
l2=[]
for i in range(0,number+1):
    if number>=0:
        l2.append(val)
        val+=1
    else:
        print("Ivalid number")
print(l2)

4)Numpy
Numpy is a python library used to working with array for large amount of data



6)Difference between C and Python Variable
#variable is a name given to memory location.
->python is a dynamically typed language, no need to mention the type of the variable in program it is automatically define the type of variable during run time.
->In C it is a statically typed language , need to be define the data type of variable in the program.

#python --> # a = 10
#C
"""
int a;
a=10;
"""

7) star Triangle
def star(n):
    num = 2*n - 2  #8
    for i in range(0, n):

        for j in range(0, num):
            print(end=" ")
        num = num - 1

        for j in range(0, i+1):
            print("* ", end="")
        print()

n = 9
star(n)


9)Fibonacci sequence


def fibonacci(n):

    a = 0
    b = 1

    if n == 1 :
        print(a)
    elif n < 0 :
        print("invald input")
    else :
        print(a)
        print(b)

        for i in range(2,n):
            c = a + b
            a = b
            b = c
            print(c)
fibonacci(10)


"""

PRIMARY KEY -> Primary key is a sql constraints which allow only unique value and it should not be null
The primary key also perform as a forign key in another table that is usefull to get data from two table
